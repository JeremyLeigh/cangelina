          <p id="cateringIntro" class="col-lg-10 col-12">We like to do catering a little differently here. After all these years in this business we discovered that when it comes to catering, menus are a barrier between customers and the food they really want. We've taken a new approach to the old way of doing things; no menus, just tailored food, made to order. Now nothing gets in the way of customers getting that perfect, no stress catering.</p>

            <h4>Order Meal</h4>
            <p>Text or emails are a good way to get the ball rolling, but when it's time to get down to business we like to start with a phone call. Come with meal ideas, flavour profiles, whatever you're looking for. We work with you to find out what we can do to make that perfect meal a reality. If going off menu isn't your thing, just ask us. We have a whole range of tasty favourites that we are happy to share.</p>

            <h4>Food Made In House</h4>
            <p>There's a reason we ask for a two week minimum for our catering orders. Once we have your order we bring in fresh, raw ingredients. We get to work making your meal in-house. We may be busy making food, but don't be a stranger. If you have any questions or concerns at any point, give us a call or schedule an appointment to come by the kitchen.</p>

            <p>When your order is ready, we'll let you know. Depending on your preference, you can come the kitchen for pick-up or have it delivered.<br><br>*If delivery is prefered please give us a heads up upon order so we can set time aside for you.</p>
